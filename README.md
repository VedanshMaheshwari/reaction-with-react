# Architectures:

- Monolith Architecture

A monolith is a single, unified software application where all components (e.g., UI, business logic, database access) are tightly integrated and run as a single process.
Single codebase, deployed as one unit. A single failure can bring down the entire system.

- Microservices Architecture:

A microservices architecture breaks an application into smaller, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific function (like authentication, payments, or notifications) and communicates via APIs (often HTTP or messaging queues).
